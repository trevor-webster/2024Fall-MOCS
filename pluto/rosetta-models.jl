md"Some models are taught everywhere. I call them **rosetta models**, as they allow you to translate between notations, formalism, solution strategies, and programming languages. Those models are also the basis for a family of models, e.g. the SI model is the basis for the SIS, SIR, SEIR, etc..

For each model, we look at its structure and interpretation. Following Weisberg (2013), we distinguish between 3 types of structures: (i) physical/concrete, (ii) mathematical, and (iii) computational. For each structure, we briefly mention the original model's construal, that is, how modellers understood the structure in question. We also briefly discuss their intepretation, or how modelers thought the models denoted the truthness of some target phenomenon. This is work in progress, but some subsection headers are link to a notebook containing the model's family.

The exponential growth is the quintessential rosetta (mathematical) model. It is broadly use because it is easily solved. This model is almost always cast in terms of population growth; bacterial, rabbits, human population, etc. Obviously, it is an idealized model. If not, the planet would be covered in rabbits.

Using a discrete time interval $\Delta t$,

$$P(t + \Delta t) = P(t) + r \Delta t \cdot P(t) \qquad (\text{Discrete})$$

Or, as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$,

$$\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = r \cdot P(t) \qquad(\text{ODE})$$

Solving the ODE, we get

$$P(t) = P(0) \cdot e^{rt} \qquad (\text{General Solution})$$

As [Roughgarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Roughgarden) says, it got'ta stop somewhere. The logistic growth is the exponential function in disguised, with some dependeny on the $P(t)$ getting closer to a carrying capacity. In ecology, population growth stops when it hits some environmental limits. When average birth/death rates per individual is a function of population size, we say that it is 'density-dependent population growth'. 

In contagion, the carrying capacity is when you run out of sick people. When assuming a closed system, and a large enough population, we can get rid of one of the two boxes above. Indeed, the number of, say, susceptible individuals is the total population size minus the infected individuals. See [Smaldino 2023, ch.4.4](https://github.com/jstonge/2024Fall-MOCS/blob/main/docs/readings/Smaldino-2023-ch4.pdf) for a nice walkthrough of the procedure.

The ODE in terms of population size is written

$$\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = r \cdot \textcolor{green}{\left(1 - \frac{N(t)}{K}\right)} \cdot N(t)$$

Where _K_ is often use for carrying capacity (in contagion example, it is our 	total population _N_). If we think in terms of recursion equation:

$$N(t+1) = N(t) + r (K - N(t)) N(t)$$

One way to write the solution is 

$$N(t) = N(0)\frac{K}{N(0) + (K - N_0)e^{-rt}}$$

The corresponding system of equations:

$$\frac{dS(t)}{dt} =  \beta S(t)I(t)$$
$$\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = \beta S(t) I(t) -\alpha I(t)$$
$$\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = \alpha I(t)$$

One way to write it in discrete time is with recursion equations:

$$S(t+1) = S(t) - \beta S(t)I(t)$$
$$I(t+1) = I(t) + \beta S(t)I(t) - \alpha I$$
$$R(t+1) = R(t) + \alpha I$$

Note that in the code below, they will magically become difference equations. Here, we are asking about the expected number of interactions between the S-I-R parts of our system. A second way to write the discrete SIR model is as follows:

$$S(t+1) = S(t) - S(t)\Big [ (1-(1-\beta)^{I(t)}\Big ]$$
$$I(t+1) = I(t) + S(t)\Big [ (1-(1-\beta)^{I(t)}\Big ] - \alpha I(t)$$
$$R(t+1) = R(t) + \alpha I(t)$$

This version makes simultaneous events impossible, as we are asking about the 'leftover' of the timesteps instead of the expected changes between parts. That is, we ask 'who remains' in, say, the susceptible box after substracting the proportion:

The system of interest here is predator-prey relationship. The arrows are not about individuals being converted from one state to another; they are about converting predator into prey, as we are assuming that the predator birth rates is dependent on number of available prey. 

Here we show equivalent ways to draw the diagrams. The leftmost diagram makes it clear that we 'convert' Lynx into Hares by drawing an arrow from L --> H. The middle diagram is more consistent with previous diagrams.  In both diagrams, we assume that rates are proportional to the compartments of origin.  The last one is more verbose, as we draw all the dependencies in the arrows.

As with the exponential model, we are assuming that the the number of predators at the next time step depends on population size at previous time step.

The system of ODEs is the following:

$$\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = \alpha H(t) - \beta L(t)H(t)$$
$$\frac{dL(t)}{dt} = -\gamma L(t) + \delta L(t)H(t)$$

> #### Interlude: what are the parts? 
> In the SIR model, the parts were the same people transitionning between states. In the Lotka-voltera model, the parts were interdependent populations of prey and predators. In pharmacokinetics, we had molecules coming in and out of an organ. In each case, the point particles within compartments were indistinguishable from each other; all susceptible people were the same, all foxes were the same, and all molecules were the same.

The more Juliet loves Romeo, the more he runs away and hides. But when Juliet gets discouraged and backs off, Romeo begins to find her strangely attractive. Moreover, Romeo is affected by his own feelings to her. Juliet, on the other hand, warms up when he loves her and grows cold when he does not."

The ODE for the damped pendulum is:

$$\frac{d^2\theta(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{\nu}{m}\frac{d\theta(t)}{dt}+\frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta(t)) = 0$$

If oscillations are small, then $\sin(\theta) \approx \theta$, and we end up with a second-order ODE of the form

$$\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + a\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + bx(t) = 0$$

which is the general equation describing the motion of a damped harmonic oscillator ($a = \nu/m$ and $b = g/l$).
